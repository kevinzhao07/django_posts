## Wolverine-DM Change Logs

#### Release Beta 1.1 ()
Primarily Bug/Design Fixes.
1. fixed bug where new messages sent wouldn't have their respective colors and only showed up with `default-blue`. 
2. changed background from `fixed` to `repeat`, leaving wolverine static.
3. DateTime model entries will now be shown in EST (UTC-5:00) instead of UTC.
4. Home page has a welcome message for users. It's now easier to see who you're logged in as, and statistics are offerred for users. 

#### Release Beta 1.0 (Released 04-25-2020 2230 EST)
First Release of 1.0 of **Wolverteen De-UM**! Might think about changing the name to Wolverine-DM but for now, I'm leaving it like this. There's a lot of bugs but hopefully the beta testers will figure them out.
